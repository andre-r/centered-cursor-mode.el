= centered-cursor-mode.el
An emacs minor mode for smooth scrolling

Makes the cursor stay vertically in a defined position (usually centered) while scrolling. So instead of moving the cursor up and down it moves the page like a pager.

The vertical position can be customized.

The code is still in development (see link:TODO.adoc[todo list]).

Also see the development branch link:https://github.com/andre-r/centered-cursor-mode.el/tree/dev[] which contains several changes. It is faster and has better customization. But it lacks one feature for now: because of performance issues, at the end of the buffer the cursor it is still recentered, so that the text does not align with the end of the window.

== Usage

To install using https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package[`use-package`]:

[,lisp]
----
(use-package centered-cursor-mode
  :demand
  :config
  ;; Optional, enables centered-cursor-mode in all buffers.
  (global-centered-cursor-mode))
----

You can activate in a single buffer:

`M-x centered-cursor-mode`

or enable globally:

`M-x global-centered-cursor-mode`

Customizable variables begin with `ccm-`.

== Technical

If recentering is triggered after some sort of mouse interaction and you don't
expect it to, this might indicate an incompatibility with some other mode you
are using. A quick way to figure out what commands are actually triggered when
you interact with the mouse is to use `command-log-mode` which will show you a
stream of the command history as the commands are being evaluated.

If any of the commands triggered on mouse interaction is not included in
`ccm-ignored-commands`, you have found the cause.
