;;; Todo list: https://github.com/andre-r/centered-cursor-mode.el/blob/master/TODO.adoc

;;; Commentary:

;; Makes the cursor stay vertically in place in a window. Typically centered, but
;; other positions are possible like golden ratio. Instead of the cursor moving up
;; and down the buffer scrolls, giving the feeling like a pager and always having a
;; context around the cursor.
;;
;; The vertical position can not only customised but also instantly adjusted (see
;; `centered-cursor-bindings').

;; To load put that in .emacs:
;;     (require 'centered-cursor-mode)
;; To activate do:
;;     M-x centered-cursor-mode
;; for buffer local or
;;     M-x global-centered-cursor-mode
;; for global minor mode.
;; Also possible: put that in .emacs
;;     (and
;;      (require 'centered-cursor-mode)
;;      (global-centered-cursor-mode +1))
;; to always have centered-cursor-mode on in all buffers.

;; Alternatives:
;; -scroll-preserve-screen-position: only works when scrolling, i.e. when point
;;     leaving window (pgup, pgdn)
;; - scroll-margin, maximum-scroll-margin: maximum is max. 0.5 and leaves 2-3 lines
;;     tolerance
;; - scroll-lock-mode

;;; Change Log:
;; 2020-TODO andre-r
;;   * refactored and simplified
;;   * simplier and more robust customisations
;;     * nicer customisation widgets and validation
;;     * no more ccm-recenter-at-end-of-file to inhibit recentering at the end of
;;       file, as it is a performance problem; maybe another solution is possible
;;   * no animation after suspended recentering, line is now highlighted
;;     (animation can be done again by function variable centered-cursor--jump-recenter-function)
;;
;; 2020-05-07 hlissner
;;   * autoload global-centered-cursor-mode
;; 2019-03-06 kqr
;;   * more customisable way to inhibit recentering after a command:
;;     new defcustom ccm-inhibit-centering-when
;;   * new ignored command evil-mouse-drag-region
;; 2019-02-24 Gollum999
;;   * Fix aggressive centering while dragging mouse (selecting text doesn't scroll)
;; 2019-02-05 andre-r
;;   * tip from MATTHIAS Andreas
;;     - replaced forward-line with next-line in ccm-scroll-up and ccm-scroll-down;
;;       scrolled too far in visual-line-mode
;; 2018-01-12 andre-r
;;   * #3: Centering does not take line-height into account
;;     - added new function for calculating visible lines
;;   * #2: Bug with collapsed lines (eg. org-mode)
;;     - used count-screen-lines instead of count-lines
;; 2017-08-30 chrm
;;   * Fixed a bug with recentering at end of file
;; 2015-10-01 Hinrik Örn Sigurðsson <hinrik.sig@gmail.com>
;;   * Avoided calling count-lines when unnecessary, which
;;     fixes slow scrolling in large files
;; 2015-03-01  andre-r
;;   * fixed bug where Emacs without X support (emacs-nox) didn't find mouse-wheel-mode
;; 2009-08-31  andre-r
;;   * replaced window-body-height with window-text-height
;;     (partially visible lines are not counted in window-text-height)
;;   * bug fixed in ccm-vpos-recenter
;;     (some parentheses where wrong after the last update)
;; 2009-02-23  andre-r
;;   * some simplifications
;; 2009-02-22  andre-r
;;   * some tips from Drew Adams:
;;     - new local variable coding:utf-8
;;     - made recenter-sequence a defvar
;;     - added groups scrolling and convenience
;;     - replaced mouse-4 and mouse-5 with
;;       mouse-wheel-up-event and mouse-wheel-down-event
;;     - added scroll-bar-toolkit-scroll to ccm-ignored-commands
;;     - made ccm-ignored-commands customisable
;;   * removed a bug where it didn't work with more than one window
;;     displaying the same buffer
;;   * added function for page up and down scrolling
;;     (standard ones didn't work well with this mode)
;;   * made the animation delay customisable
;;   * made the initial vertical position customisable
;;   * made the behaviour at the end of the file customisable
;; 2008-02-02  andre-r
;;   * fixed bug that led to wrong-type-argument
;;     when opening a new buffer
;;   * some other minor stuff
;; 2007-09-24  andre-r
;;   * added global minor mode
;; 2007-09-21  andre-r
;;   * not recentering at end of buffer
;;   * defvar animate-first-start-p
;; 2007-09-14  andre-r
;;   * inital release
